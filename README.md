# My Spotify Project

Hey there! This is my personal project to help me organize my music library and create playlists based on my preferences. I want to be able to group my songs into suitable playlists for different moods, settings, and occasions such as:

* Creating a karaoke playlist by selecting tracks with a high vocal range and low tempo.
* Creating a workout playlist by selecting tracks with a high tempo and energy.
* Creating a relaxing playlist by selecting tracks with a low tempo and low energy.

# What can it do?

This project provides some cool features:

* Access to Spotify's Web API to retrieve data about my playlists, tracks, audio features, and audio analysis
* Study track characteristics to be grouped into playlists
* Automatic creation of playlists based on my preferences

# How do I use it?

To use this project, you will need to do a few things:

1. Create a Spotify account if you don't already have one. (Don't worry, it's free!)
2. Create a Spotify Developer account and register your app to get a `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET` and your `USER_ID`. (It's not as complicated as it sounds!)
3. Setup your Python environment.
4. Run the Python script to authenticate your app, retrieve your data from Spotify, and analyze your music library.
5. Use the output to create your own playlists, or use the playlist creation feature of the project to automatically generate playlists based on your preferences.
